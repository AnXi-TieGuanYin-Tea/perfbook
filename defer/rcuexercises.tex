\subsection{RCU Exercises}
\label{sec:defer:RCU Exercises}

This section is organized as a series of Quick Quizzes that invite you
to apply RCU to a number of examples earlier in this book.
The answer to each Quick Quiz gives some hints, and also contains a
pointer to a later section where the solution is explained at length.
The \url{rcu_read_lock()}, \url{rcu_read_unlock()}, \url{rcu_dereference()},
\url{rcu_assign_pointer()}, and \url{synchronize_rcu()} primitives should
suffice for most of these exercises.

\QuickQuiz{}
	The statistical-counter implementation shown in
	Figure~\ref{fig:count:Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
	(\url{count_end.c})
	used a global lock to guard the summation in \url{read_count()},
	which resulted in poor performance and negative scalability.
	How could you use RCU to provide \url{read_count()} with
	excellent performance and good scalability.
	(Keep in mind that \url{read_count()}'s scalability will
	necessarily be limited by its need to scan all threads'
	counters.)
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Hint: place the global variable \url{finalcount} and the
	array \url{counterp[]} into a single RCU-protected struct.
	At initialization time, this structure would be allocated
	and set to all zero and \url{NULL}.

	The \url{inc_count()} function would be unchanged.

	The \url{read_count()} function would use \url{rcu_read_lock()}
	instead of acquiring \url{final_mutex}, and would need to
	use \url{rcu_dereference()} to acquire a reference to the
	current structure.

	The \url{count_register_thread()} function would set the
	array element corresponding to the newly created thread
	to reference that thread's per-thread \url{counter} variable.

	The \url{count_unregister_thread()} function would need to
	allocate a new structure, acquire \url{final_mutex},
	copy the old structure to the new one, add the outgoing
	thread's \url{counter} variable to the total, \url{NULL}
	the pointer to this same \url{counter} variable,
	use \url{rcu_assign_pointer()} to install the new structure
	in place of the old one, release \url{final_mutex},
	wait for a grace period, and finally free the old structure.

	Does this really work?
	Why or why not?
