\QuickQuizChapter{chp:Deferred Processing}{Deferred Processing}

The strategy of deferring work goes back before the dawn of recorded
history, and has generally been derided as procrastination or
even shear laziness.
However, in the last few decades have workers recognized this strategy's value
in simplifying and streamlining parallel algorithms~\cite{Kung80,HMassalinPhD}.
Believe it or not, in parallel programming, laziness often performs and
scales better than does industriousness!
General approaches to work deferral in parallel programming include
queuing, reference counting, and RCU.
