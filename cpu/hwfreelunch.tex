\section{Hardware Free Lunch?}
\label{sec:cpu:Hardware Free Lunch?}

The major reason that concurrency has been receiving so much focus over
the past few years is the end of Moore's-Law induced single-threaded
performance increases
(or ``free lunch''~\cite{HerbSutter2008EffectiveConcurrency}),
as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:intro:Clock-Frequency Trend for Intel CPUs} on
page~\pageref{fig:intro:Clock-Frequency Trend for Intel CPUs}.
This section briefly surveys a few ways that hardware designers
might be able to bring back some form of the ``free lunch''.

However, the preceding section presented some substantial hardware
obstacles to exploiting concurrency.
One severe physical limitation that hardware designers face is the
finite speed of light.
As noted in
Figure~\ref{fig:cpu:System Hardware Architecture} on
page~\pageref{fig:cpu:System Hardware Architecture},
light can travel only about an 8-centimeters round trip
in a vacuum during the duration of a 1.8 GHz clock period.
This distance drops to about 3 centimeters for a 5 GHz clock.
Both of these distances are relatively small compared to the size
of a modern computer system.

To make matters even worse, electrons in silicon move from three to
thirty times more slowly than does light in a vacuum, and common
clocked logic constructs run still more slowly, for example, a
memory reference may need to wait for a local cache lookup to complete
before the request may be passed on to the rest of the system.
Furthermore, relatively low speed and high power drivers are required
to move electrical signals from one silicon die to another, for example,
to communicate between a CPU and main memory.

There are nevertheless some technologies (both hardware and software)
that might help improve matters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	3D integration,
\item	Novel materials and processes,
\item	Substituting light for electrons,
\item	Special-purpose accelerators, and
\item	Existing parallel software.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these is described in one of the following sections.

\subsection{3D Integration}
\label{sec:cpu:3D Integration}

3D integration is the practice of bonding very thin silicon dies to
each other in a vertical stack.
This practice provides potential benefits, but also poses
significant fabrication challenges~\cite{JohnKnickerbocker2008_3DI}.

\caption{Latency Benefit of 3D Integration}
\label{fig:cpu:Latency Benefit of 3D Integration}
\end{figure}

Perhaps the most important benefit of 3DI is decreased path length through
the system, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:cpu:Latency Benefit of 3D Integration}.
A 3-centimeter silicon die is replaced with a stack of four 1.5-centimeter
dies, in theory decreasing the maximum path through the system by a factor
of two, keeping in mind that each layer is quite thin.
In addition, given proper attention to design and placement,
long horizontal electrical connections (which are both slow and
power hungry) can be replaced by short vertical electrical connections,
which are both faster and more power efficient.

However, delays due to levels of clocked logic will not be decreased
by 3D integration, and significant manufacturing, testing, power-supply,
and heat-dissipation problems must be solved for 3D integration to
reach production while still delivering on its promise.
