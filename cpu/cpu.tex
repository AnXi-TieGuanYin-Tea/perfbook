\QuickQuizChapter{chp:Hardware and its Habits}

Most people have an intuitive understanding that passing messages between
systems is considerably more expensive than performing simple calculations
within the confines of a single system.
However, it is not always so clear that communicating among threads within
the confines of a single shared-memory system can also be quite expensive.
This chapter therefore looks the cost of synchronization and communication
within a shared-memory system.
This chapter merely scratches the surface of shared-memory parallel
hardware design; readers desiring more detail would do well to start
with a recent edition of
Hennessy's and Patterson's classic text~\cite{Hennessy95a}.
