\QuickQuizChapter{chp:Hardware and its Habits}

Most people have an intuitive understanding that passing messages between
systems is considerably more expensive than performing simple calculations
within the confines of a single system.
However, it is not always so clear that communicating among threads within
the confines of a single shared-memory system can also be quite expensive.
This chapter therefore looks the cost of synchronization and communication
within a shared-memory system.
This chapter merely scratches the surface of shared-memory parallel
hardware design; readers desiring more detail would do well to start
with a recent edition of
Hennessy's and Patterson's classic text~\cite{Hennessy95a}.

\QuickQuiz{}
	Why should parallel programmers bother learning low-level
	properties of the hardware?
	Wouldn't it be easier, better, and more general to remain at
	a higher level of abstraction?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	It might well be easier to ignore the detailed properties of
	the hardware, but in most cases it would be quite foolish
	to do so.
	If you accept that the only purpose of parallelism is to
	increase performance, and if you further accept that
	performance depends on detailed properties of the hardware,
	then it logically follows that parallel programmers are going
	to need to know at least a few hardware properties.

	This is the case in most engineering disciplines.
	Would \emph{you} want to use a bridge designed by an
	engineer who did not understand the properties of
	the concrete and steel making up that bridge?
	If not, why would you expect a parallel programmer to be
	able to develop competent parallel software without at least
	\emph{some} understanding of the underlying hardware?
