\chapter{Data Ownership}
\label{chp:Data Ownership}

Per-CPU and per-task/process/thread data.

Function shipping vs. data shipping.

Big question: how much local vs. global processing?  How frequent,
how expensive, ...  Better to divide or to centralize?

Relationship to map/reduce?  Message passing!

@@@ populate with problems showing benefits of coupling data ownership
with other approaches.
For example, work-stealing schedulers.
Perhaps also move memory allocation here, though its current location
is quite good.
