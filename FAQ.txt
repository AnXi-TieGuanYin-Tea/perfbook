1.	OK, I have downloaded this stuff.  What do I do now???

	A.	Type "make" from the top-level directory.  If all goes
		well, this will produce a file named "perfbook-2up.pdf",
		which prints two virtual pages per physical page.

2.	The Makefile cannot find latex.  What is it and where can I
	find it?

	A.	The "latex" package is Don Knuth's digital typesetting
		program.  On Ubuntu, install the "texlive" set of
		packages.  Other systems might provide packages named
		"latex" or "tex".

3.	Why the heck did you use this strange-looking text-based
	ca. 1980s typesetting package instead of something more
	modern, like OpenOffice?

	A.	Although latex takes a bit of getting used to, its
		automatic handling of bibliographies, tables of contents,
		figures, and tables is extremely useful for large documents.
		In addition, its text-based nature is much more compatible
		with modern source-code-control systems such as "git".

		Finally, the more-modern WYSIWYG text formatters tend
		to get a bit cranky when working with hundreds-of-pages
		documents.

4.	The Makefile cannot find psnup.  Where do I find it?

	A.	On Linux platforms, install the "psutils" package.
		Alternatively, type "make perfbook.pdf" rather than
		just "make" in order to get single-page-per-page
		format, thereby avoiding the need for psnup.

5.	Can I contribute?

	A.	Of course!!!  The contribution process is similar to that
		of the Linux kernel and of the Samba project.  See the
		Documentation/SubmittingPatches file in a Linux source tree.  

		Please put a "Signed-off-by:" line in your patches,
		for an example see: http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/15/219.

		This "Signed-off-by:" line has very specific meaning as
		follows:

		---------------------------------------------------------

		By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

		1.	The contribution was created in whole or in part
			by me and I have the right to submit it under
			the open source license indicated in the file; or

		2.	The contribution is based upon previous work
			that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered
			under an appropriate open source License and I
			have the right under that license to submit that
			work with modifications, whether created in whole
			or in part by me, under the same open source
			license (unless I am permitted to submit under
			a different license), as indicated in the file; or

		3.	The contribution was provided directly to me by
			some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c)
			and I have not modified it.

		4.	The contribution is made free of any other party's
			intellectual property claims or rights.

		5.	I understand and agree that this project and the
			contribution are public and that a record of the
			contribution (including all personal information
			I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
			maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
			consistent with this project or the open source
			license(s) involved.

		---------------------------------------------------------

		This is similar to the DCO used for the Linux kernel,
		with the addition of #4.  This is says that you wrote
		the contribution yourself, as opposed to having (say)
		copied it from somewhere.  If multiple people authored
		a contribution, each should have a "Signed-off-by:" line.
