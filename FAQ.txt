1.	OK, I have downloaded this stuff.  What do I do now???

	A.	Type "make" from the top-level directory.  If all goes
		well, this will produce a file named "perfbook-2up.pdf",
		which prints two virtual pages per physical page.

2.	The Makefile cannot find latex.  What is it and where can I
	find it?

	A.	The "latex" package is Don Knuth's digital typesetting
		program.  On Ubuntu, install the "texlive" set of
		packages.  Other systems might provide packages named
		"latex" or "tex".

3.	Why the heck did you use this strange-looking text-based
	ca. 1980s typesetting package instead of something more
	modern, like OpenOffice?

	A.	Although latex takes a bit of getting used to, its
		automatic handling of bibliographies, tables of contents,
		figures, and tables is extremely useful for large documents.
		In addition, its text-based nature is much more compatible
		with modern source-code-control systems such as "git".

		In addition, the more-modern WYSIWYG text formatters tend
		to get a bit cranky when working with hundreds-of-pages
		documents.

4.	The Makefile cannot find psnup.  Where do I find it?

	A.	On Linux platforms, install the "psutils" package.
		Alternatively, type "make perfbook.pdf" rather than
		just "make" in order to get single-page-per-page
		format.
