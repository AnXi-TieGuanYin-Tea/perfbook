\section*{Acknowledgements}

We owe thanks to many CPU architects for patiently explaining the
instruction- and memory-reordering features of their CPUs, particularly
Wayne Cardoza, Ed Silha, Anton Blanchard, Tim Slegel, Juergen Probst,
Ingo Adlung, and Ravi Arimilli.
Wayne deserves special thanks for his patience in explaining Alpha's reordering
of dependent loads, a lesson that Paul resisted quite strenuously!

We owe much to the many people behind the IBM Linux Technology Center's
Advanced Build and Test system (ABAT), including Martin Bligh, Andy
Whitcroft, Dustin Kirkland, and many others, as this system provided much
of the data cited herein.
